# End-to-End Testing Example

This folder contains an example project designed to help you understand and practice writing different types of tests: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. This is intended for an introductory level computer science course.

## Tasks

1. **Write Unit Tests**
     - Focus on testing individual functions or components in isolation.

2. **Write Integration Tests**
     - Test the interaction between multiple components or modules.

3. **Write End-to-End Tests**
     - Simulate real user scenarios and test the entire application flow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `go mod tidy`.
3. Run the tests using the appropriate commands

Happy testing!
